# **ConvoyChat Code of Conduct Violations' Reporting Guidelines**

**Last updated: January 18, 2023**

The guidelines provided below are for reporting violations to the Code of Conduct, not instructions on how to report issues.

## **Identify**

The first step in reporting Code of Conduct violations is to identify the section of the Code of Conduct that has been violated.

This is a crucial step in helping us hold the right person responsible and not just anyone.

After identifying the section in violation, please identify the person(s) who have violated it. Please record information such as their email address(es) and names/usernames which may be useful to us in identifying them too.

## **Prepare**

Before reporting, please make sure to prepare a rough draft of how you'll report your issue. Below is a template you could use if you're opening an issue:

```markdown
# Code of Conduct Violation

**Information of violater**

Email: johndoe@violation.co
Name: John Doe
Username: @johndoe

## Offenses

The above violater has broken **rule 3**(replace with rule broken) of the acceptable behaviors. He has been warned and confronted by the community more than once and has refused to change.

## Contact Info

You may reach me at [janesmith@gmail.com](mailto:janesmith@gmail.com)

## Agreements

I agree that the above information is accurate.

I agree that I will not speak to anyone else about this, and that I have the consent of at least one other affected person to report this.

I also agree to be bound by the Code of Conduct.
```

Or if you plan to send an email, you can use the template below:

```plain text
Code of Conduct Violation

My name is _______. I am writing this email to report a violation to **rule 3**(replace with rule broken) of the Code of Conduct.

Below is the information I've collected on the violater:

Name - John Doe
Email - johndoe@violater.co
Username - @johndoe

I understand that I need to comply with the Code of Conduct myself to report and agree to be bound by it. I also agree that the above information is accurate, and that I have to have received the consent of at least one other affected person to report this.

Regards,
{name}
```
