# ConvoyChat Contributors' Code of Conduct

**Last updated: January 18, 2023**

## 1. Purpose and Pledge

A primary goal of the ConvoyChat Authors is to be inclusive to the largest number of contributors, with the most varied and diverse backgrounds possible. As such, we are committed to providing a friendly, safe and welcoming environment for all, regardless of age, body size, gender, sexual orientation, ability, ethnicity, socio-economic status, nationality, race, and religion (or lack thereof).

This Code of Conduct outlines our expectations for all those who participate in our community, as well as the consequences for unacceptable behavior.

We invite all those who participate in the ConvoyChat project to help us create safe and positive experiences for everyone.

## 2. Open [Source/Culture/Tech] Citizenship

A supplemental goal of this Code of Conduct is to increase open [source/culture/tech] citizenship by encouraging participants to recognize and strengthen the relationships between our actions and their effects on our community.

Communities mirror the societies in which they exist and positive action is essential to counteract the many forms of inequality and abuses of power that exist in society.

If you see someone who is making an extra effort to ensure our community is welcoming, friendly, and encourages all participants to contribute to the fullest extent, we want to know.

## 3. Our Standards

**The following behaviors are expected and requested of all community members:**

 * Participate in an authentic and active way. In doing so, you contribute to the health and longevity of this community.
 * Exercise consideration and respect in your speech and actions.
 * Attempt collaboration before conflict.
 * Gracefully accept constructive criticism.
 * Show empathy towards other community members.
 * Refrain from demeaning, discriminatory, or harassing behavior and speech.
 * Be respectful of differing viewpoints and experiences.
 * Be mindful of your surroundings and of your fellow participants. Alert community leaders if you notice a dangerous situation, or violations of this Code of Conduct, even if they seem inconsequential.

**The following behaviors are considered harassment and are unacceptable within our community:**

 * Violence, threats of violence or violent language directed against another person.
 * Sexist, racist, homophobic, transphobic, ableist or otherwise discriminatory jokes and language.
 * Posting or displaying sexually explicit or violent material.
 * Posting or threatening to post other people's personally identifying information ("doxxing").
 * Personal insults, particularly those related to gender, sexual orientation, race, religion, or disability.
 * Public or private harassment.
 * Inappropriate photography or recording.
 * Unwelcome sexual attention. This includes, sexualized comments or jokes; inappropriate touching, groping, and unwelcomed sexual advances.
 * Deliberate intimidation, stalking or following (online or in person).
 * Advocating for, or encouraging, any of the above behavior.
 * Sustained disruption of community events, including talks and presentations.

## 4. Our Responsibilities

Project maintainers are responsible for clarifying the standards of acceptable behavior and are expected to take appropriate and fair corrective action in response to any instances of unacceptable behavior.

## 5. Consequences of Unacceptable Behavior

Unacceptable behavior from any community member, including sponsors and those with decision-making authority, will not be tolerated.

Anyone asked to stop unacceptable behavior is expected to comply immediately.

If a community member engages in unacceptable behavior, the community organizers may take any action they deem appropriate, up to and including a temporary ban or permanent expulsion from the community without warning (and without refund in the case of a paid event) for other behaviors that they deem inappropriate, threatening, offensive, or harmful.

## 6. Reporting Guidelines

If you are subject to or witness unacceptable behavior, or have any other concerns, please notify a community organizer as soon as possible.

Additionally, community organizers are available to help community members engage with local law enforcement or to otherwise help those experiencing unacceptable behavior feel safe.

## 7. Addressing Grievances

If you feel you have been falsely or unfairly accused of violating this Code of Conduct, you should notify @C-EO with a concise description of your grievance. Your grievance will be handled in accordance with our existing governing policies.

All grieviances are handled seriously.

## 8. Scope

We expect all community participants (contributors, paid or otherwise; sponsors; and other guests) to abide by this Code of Conduct in all community venues--online and in-person--as well as in all one-on-one communications pertaining to community business.

This Code of Conduct and its related procedures also applies to unacceptable behavior occurring outside the scope of community activities when such behavior has the potential to adversely affect the safety and well-being of community members.

## 9. Enforcement

Instances of abusive, harassing, or otherwise unacceptable behavior may be reported by contacting the project team using this [email](mailto:convoychat@gmail.com). All complaints will be reviewed and investigated and will result in a response that is deemed necessary and appropriate to the circumstances. The project team is obligated to maintain confidentiality with regard to the reporter of an incident. Further details of specific enforcement policies may be posted separately.

Project maintainers who do not follow or enforce the Code of Conduct in good faith may face temporary or permanent repercussions as determined by other members of the project's leadership.
