## <a id="introduction"></a> üëã Introduction

ConvoyChat is a GraphQL realtime group messaging app based on React and Typescript.

ConvoyChat is and will always remain free and openly available under the **GNU General Public License Version 3** license. It can be
used and modified in any way by anyone.

The ConvoyChat project is maintained by the [C-EO](https://github.com/C-EO) and the [ConvoyChat Authors](https://github.com/c-eo/convoychat/graphs/contributors).

As the ConvoyChat Authors, we're committed to building a community that is welcoming and inclusive: an environment where people are encouraged to share ideas, treat each other with respect, and collaborate
towards the best solutions. To reinforce our commitment, we have adopted a slightly modified **[Code of Conduct](/docs/oss/code_of_conduct.md)** for the ConvoyChat project.

_**Please follow it in all your interactions with the project. Any violations of the Code of Conduct will result in serious consequences.**_

## <a id="access"></a> üîê Source Code Access

The source code to the ConvoyChat project can be accessed via a oublic-access repository on [GitHub](https://github.com/c-eo/convoychat).

This `main` branch of this repository contains the ongoing development of the ConvoyChat project.

All other releases of ConvoyChat can be found under their respective branches which may or may not follow a **[Semantic Versioning (Semver)](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html)** pattern; the source code for `v0.0.0-beta` of ConvoyChat can be found under the **v0.x-beta** branch.

If you wish to clone the repository, use the command below:

```bash
$ git clone https://github.com/c-eo/convoychat.git
```

**Requires Git to be installed on your local machine.**

## <a id="issue-reporting"></a> üìÑ Issue Reporting

Like any other web application out there, ConvoyChat also encounters issues from time to time.

To be able to tackle those issues, we resorted to using [GitHub Issues](https://github.com/issues).

The ConvoyChat project issue tracker can be found [here](https://github.com/c-eo/convoychat/issues).

**The project's issue system is publicly readable --- however, you must have an account registered with GitHub to create a new issue.**

Before reporting any issue, please endeavor to check if a similar issue is already open. If there is one, please add a comment with additional information, react to it with a üëç, and subscribe to its notifications.

**Please note that due to other obligations, putting aside the ConvoyChat project, we are sometimes slow to respond to issues, especially if a bug is cosmetic, or a suggestion is vague or low in priority.**

### <a id="bugs"></a> üêû Reporting Bugs

Found a bug within ConvoyChat? All bugs can be reported using the `bug_report.yml` and `ui_bug_report.yml` templates of **[ConvoyChat's GitHub Issues](https://github.com/c-eo/convoychat/issues/new/choose)**.

The ConvoyChat project is very important to us as its developers, thus we take all bug reports very seriously.

If you find a bug, **DON'T** hesistate to report it to us immediately.

We will try our best to acknowledge legitimate bug reports within **14 days**.

### <a id="suggestions"></a> üôã‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è Suggestions

Most of our ideas come from the ConvoyChat community - our users and supporters.

We would love to here to each of your suggestions for ConvoyChat and see if its implementable.

All suggestions can be reported to us using [GitHub Issues](https://github.com/c-eo/convoychat/issues/new/choose) using the `suggestions.yml` template.

### <a id="vulnerabilities"></a> ‚ùó Security Vulnerabilites

In the world of technology today, security vulnerabilities are the biggest threat to everyone.

They can either lead to information being leaked or destruction of machines.

They cause more damage than a bug would, and ConvoyChat is no exception. In order to curb this threat, we have set up a **[Vulnerability Disclosure Policy](/docs/oss/security.md)** so that you can inform us of such threats.

Please **DON'T** and under no circumstances should you discuss undisclosed security vulnerabilities on any public mailing list.

We as the ConvoyChat Authors have a long history of handling reported vulnerabilities promptly and
effectively on many projects and we respect and acknowledge responsible reporters.

## <a id="development"></a> üíª Local Development

Before we jump to the pull request process, you would have to set up your own instance to be able to make visible changes to the project.

To start off the development journey, you will need to sign up to the services listed below:

- **[Auth0](https://auth0.com)** - For user authentication
- **[Google Cloud Platform](https://cloud.google.com)** - For OAuth 2 support
- **[Cloudinary (Optional)](https://cloudinary.com)** - For image uploads
- **[MongoDB](https://mongodb.com)** - For database support

You could choose to sign up for **MongoDB Atlas** or you could download it and set it up locally.

Now that you're ready, you can start the development.

**Step 1 - Clone ConvoyChat**

The first step in deploying your own instance of ConvoyChat is to clone this repo:

```sh
git clone https://github.com/c-eo/convoychat.git
```

**Step 2 - Install Dependencies**

The next step is to install all required dependencies.

Install server side dependencies with this command:

```sh
cd convoychat
npm install
```

Then install the client side dependencies with this command:

```sh
cd client
npm install
```

**Step 3 - Environment Variables**

After installing all required dependencies, change the directory to the convoychat root folder with this command:

```sh
cd /path/to/convoychat
```

In the root folder you will find a file structure like the one below:

```txt
convoychat
|
|‚îÄ‚îÄ .convoychat
|‚îÄ‚îÄ .github
|‚îÄ‚îÄ .vscode
|‚îÄ‚îÄ client
|‚îÄ‚îÄ docs
|‚îÄ‚îÄ server
|‚îÄ‚îÄ .dockerignore
|‚îÄ‚îÄ .editorconfig
|‚îÄ‚îÄ .env.example
|‚îÄ‚îÄ .eslintignore
|‚îÄ‚îÄ .eslintrc.json
|‚îÄ‚îÄ .gitignore
|‚îÄ‚îÄ .prettierignore
|‚îÄ‚îÄ .prettierrc
|‚îÄ‚îÄ .travis.yml
|‚îÄ‚îÄ changelog.md
|‚îÄ‚îÄ docker-compose.yml
|‚îÄ‚îÄ Dockerfile
|‚îÄ‚îÄ jest.config.js
|‚îÄ‚îÄ LICENSE.md
|‚îÄ‚îÄ package-lock.json
|‚îÄ‚îÄ package.json
|‚îÄ‚îÄ readme.md
|‚îÄ‚îÄ tsconfig.json
```

In this next step, you will need to fill in the environment variables.

Follow the steps below:

- Create a new file named `.env` in the root folder.
- Open the [.env.example](/.env.example) file.
- Copy the contents of _.env.example_  and paste them in the _.env_ file.
- Replace all the dummy keys with your own valid ones.

**Step 3.1 - Setup Auth0 & Google OAuth 2**

You'll need Auth0 and Google OAuth 2 to handle user authentication.

Follow this guide for setting up Auth0 for NodeJS web applications.

> https://auth0.com/docs/quickstart/webapp/nodejs

It is **very important** that you setup all the callback URLs correctly in your Auth0 Dashboard.

To setup Google OAuth 2 follow the steps below:

- Create a Google account if you don't have one.

[![Organization Creation](/client/public/favicon.ico)](https://console.cloud.google.com)

- Visit **[Google Cloud Platform](https://cloud.google.com)** and log in.

[![Organization Creation](/client/public/favicon.ico)](https://console.cloud.google.com)

- After logging in, you'll be redirected to **[Google Cloud Console](https://console.cloud.google.com)**.

[![Organization Creation](/client/public/favicon.ico)](https://console.cloud.google.com)

- Create a an organization.

[![Organization Creation](/client/public/favicon.ico)](https://console.cloud.google.com)

- Create a new project under that organization.

[![Organization Creation](/client/public/favicon.ico)](https://console.cloud.google.com)

- Navigate to the `Credentials` page.

[![Organization Creation](/client/public/favicon.ico)](https://console.cloud.google.com)

- Navigate to the `OAuth 2 Consent Screen` page.

[![Organization Creation](/client/public/favicon.ico)](https://console.cloud.google.com)

- Follow the steps to create an OAuth 2 application.
- After creating the OAuth 2 application, copy the `Client id` and `Client secret`.
- Head back to your Auth0 dashboard, and replace the Google OAuth 2 Auth0 keys with your own.

And now you're done setting up Google OAuth 2.
